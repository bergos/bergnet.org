# New blog

I have many small projects which don't have a real home on the web.
My PHP code to manage my [WebID](https://www.bergnet.org/people/bergi/card) still does a good job, but the [blog](https://www.bergnet.org/people/bergi/blog/) software part would need a rewrite.
Right now I don't have time for this, so I choose [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).
It's implemented in JavaScript, generates static files and supports markdown posts.
Linked Data support would be cool, but let's be pragmatic.
I hope you like my adaption of the theme.
