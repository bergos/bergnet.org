I found [this](https://www.hobbycreek.com/products/third-hand) cool Third Hand from Hobby Creek, which is doing a great job to fasten objects for soldering.
It only lacks a magnifier.
The stand of the Third Hand has some more holes which could be used to add another arm with a magnifier.
A complete set was not available, so built one myself.
I bought [this set of arms](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B008O14864/) and a [magnifier](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B017ASRKO8/) with battery driven LED light.
The magnifier should be removable.
I used [Polymorph Thermoplastic](http://www.thermoworx.com/polymorph/) to build a mount where the magnifier can be inserted.
The thermoplastic was also used to attach the mount to the arm.

Quite simple but very usefull.
